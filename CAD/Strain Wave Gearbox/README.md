# Credit to user_454693624 over on Makerworld for the Strain-Wave Gearbox design!

### You can find the files for the gearbox design at this link:

------
The CAD in this repository contains two modified components of user_454693624's design. First is the Output Hub. I have included this piece in this folder as I needed to extend the hub and change the mounting to threaded inserts. The second modified part is the Cap, which you will find combined in the frames of the Upper Arm, Forearm, and Wrist components.

Again, thank you to user_454693624 for giving me permission to use their design and go check it out!
