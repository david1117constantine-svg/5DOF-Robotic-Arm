# 6DOF-Robotic-Arm

This repository is for my very first Hack Club Blueprint Grant Submission, along with anyone else who wants to watch my progress and build their own 6DOF robot arm.

## Current Progress
*As of January 8th, 2026*

This is the current state of my arm. In *Fig.1*, the Forearm is a copy of the Upper Arm for visualization purposes. 

I have reached the point at which the stepper motors I am using, 28BYJ-48 Unipolar Stepper Motors with ULN2003 drivers from Elegoo (As seen in *Fig.2*), no longer supply the torque needed to lift anything more than the Upper Arm, and even then, they still skip a couple of teeth when the shoulder is extended by its full range of motion.
