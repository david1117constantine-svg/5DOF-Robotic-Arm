## 11/16/2025: Voron is done, first print is out of the way; Back to CAD!



## 10/25/2025: Last of the Voron parts came; Project on standby for now
Not much to this entry. I'm super excited to finally have a 3D printer again. I need to find a place to keep all the different benchys I'm about to make!

## 10/24/2025: The Birth of an Idea
Yesterday I got my new Voron V0.2 in the mail! Decided to start modeling the glimpse of an idea I saw in my head of a Robotic Arm, built all with hobby-grade 3D printing. Looks pretty trash right now, but I think with some work it should be ok. I've got a lot to learn about Fusion 360 still, so this is probably good for me. using 4040 extrusions for the base, hopefully that is a wide and sturdy enough structure to hold the arm up. Thats all I've got for now!

P.S. Sorry for the terrible quality image; it was a screenshot from my phone.
