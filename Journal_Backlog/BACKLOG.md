## 11/30/2025: Locking in; Waist progressing smoothly
I decided to start building the arm around these cheap stepper motors I found in my school's computer lab, specifically the 28-BYJ-48 with ULN2003 drivers. They seem pretty cheap, so that is good for my budget, which is basically nothing. Added the ribbing on the side for effect, looks cool, I think, and maybe it provides marginal support theoretically. Using little holes i measured out that you can pop nuts into, and then you get threads, cheaper and more accessible than heatset inserts; also less permanent. The only hardware I have right now is what is left from the 3D printer build. It won't last me the entire build, but for now, it will have to do.

You may be able to see a little bit of material that sticks out around the screw holes in the motor mount. This began by accident; however turned out that it works in my favor. The mounting holes on the 28BYJ-48 steppers are for M4 screws; however, the only screws I have on hand are M3. The M3 screws thread into the plastic, which in turn squeezes the raised material outward, centering the motor over the screw holes, and squeezing them tight onto the posts. Cool right?

Cool design feature I should mention. For now, I am sticking with the extrusions for a simple solution to a base/mount for the arm. I designed the waist with the idea of multiple mounting options in mind. There is an X pattern of crews and a circular depression in the bottom of the waist, allowing it to be connected to many mounting solutions. Still brainstorming how the actual waist joint is going to stay in place, planning on buying bearings of some sort for the spinning aspect, but we will see, I guess.

## 11/29/2025: Tuning, Tuning, Tuning; Ready to print 1st part of the Arm!
Designed a base piece that would connect the extrusions and bolt onto whatever the design for the Waise Joint will be. The first print came out fine, needed some clearance fixes though, went back into cad and it's all good now!

This was the 1st version, which was missing drilled holes for connecting the waist, along with too loose clearances.

V2 on the Voron

## 11/16/2025: Voron is done, first print is out of the way; Back to CAD!
Did some thinking about my previous design, and I think I'm gonna scratch the entire thing and start over. Gonna use 2020 extrusions along, and start from there.

## 10/25/2025: Last of the Voron parts came; Project on standby for now
Not much to this entry. I'm super excited to finally have a 3D printer again. I need to find a place to keep all the different benchys I'm about to make!

## 10/24/2025: The Birth of an Idea
Yesterday I got my new Voron V0.2 in the mail! Decided to start modeling the glimpse of an idea I saw in my head of a Robotic Arm, built all with hobby-grade 3D printing. Looks pretty trash right now, but I think with some work it should be ok. I've got a lot to learn about Fusion 360 still, so this is probably good for me. using 4040 extrusions for the base, hopefully that is a wide and sturdy enough structure to hold the arm up. Thats all I've got for now!

P.S. Sorry for the terrible quality image; it was a screenshot from my phone.
